## Bugs and feature request

The preferred way to report bugs and feature request is to use the
[GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/thsmi/recycler/issues).

But you can also send an email to schmid-thomas at gmx.net

In order to process bugs faster consider the following:

* Try if the [most recent build](https://github.com/thsmi/recycler/releases) fixes your issue.
 
* Check if you issue is already reported. The list with open issues is small. 
  Try to avoid to duplicate an issue. It slows down the development.

* Include information about your system and configuration.

* Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug
  report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? If possible 
  describe the exact steps how to reproduce the issue. 

* Do not spam or troll issues and bug reports. I do not accept bugspam, it is considered the worst thing you can do with an open source project. It slows down development. Any bug spam will be deleted without notice and the spamming user will be blocked.
